# Retrospective


## Purpose

An opportunity, at the end of each sprint, for each person on a scrum team to stop, inspect and discuss any team or organizational related topics. 

 - Inspect how the last sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
 - Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements;
- Create a plan to improve the way the Scrum team does its work.


## What to solve


- Retrospectives can help identify what puzzles people, what they want to improve, and what has become a risk to the project scope, timeline, or morale 
- At the end of a Retrospective, everyone involved should agree and decide on the action items that should be taken to improve future sprints
- This isn’t designed to get people to do more work, it’s so they enjoy the work they do
